# 4BIDS

The `IMAGEDATA/4BIDS` folder contains the example images **NOT** organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. The BIDS format provides a standardized way to organize and share neuroimaging data, making it easier to collaborate and reproduce research findings.

The example images do not refer to any real patient and here have been assigned to 4 made-up patients with the scope of creating a demo imaging dataset. They have been downloaded at: https://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/multi-contrast-pd25-atlas/
